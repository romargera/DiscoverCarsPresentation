Take-Home Task description  
“  
   
Staff Product Manager (Insurance & Ancillary)  
   
Overview  
DiscoverCars.com invests in insurance and ancillary products to strengthen customer trust, reduce  
travel-related anxiety during booking and vehicle pickup, and diversify revenue beyond core car  
rentals. Our focus is on delivering clear customer value, transparent coverage, compliant execution,  
and measurable commercial outcomes (for example, higher protection attach rates and sustainable  
margins).  
We are looking for senior product leaders who can balance customer value, business impact,  
regulatory requirements, and delivery feasibility, while aligning cross-functional teams and external  
partners to ship meaningful products.  
Your challenge  
Define a strategic plan to launch a new Travel Protection product for DiscoverCars.com.  
Choose one specific protection concept (for example, coverage that meaningfully reduces common  
travel frictions or disruptions) and describe how you would take it from idea → MVP → initial scale  
in a responsible, compliant, and commercially viable way. **Please keep the scope pragmatic and**  
**staged.**  
Please cover the following areas:  
• Customer problem & opportunity  
What customer problem does this solve, and why is it valuable for our marketplace?  
• Business rationale   
How does this product create business value? Use simple assumptions and reasonable ranges  
rather than exact internal data.  
• Trust & compliance  
How would you ensure clear communication, customer trust, and legal/regulatory  
compliance?  
• Execution plan  
Outline a realistic path from MVP to phased rollout, including key dependencies and risks.  
• Measurement & learning  
Which primary and guardrail metrics would you track, and how would you learn and iterate?  
• Team & partner alignment  
How would you work with internal teams and an insurance partner to deliver, iterate, and  
improve the product?  
We care more about clear thinking, structure, and well-reasoned trade-offs than about perfect data.Task process & format  
• Preparation time:  
Up to 1 week  
• Submission:  
**Please prepare your solution and share your materials with us in advance. The materials**  
**should be clear and complete enough for us to fully understand your thinking and proposed**  
**approach without additional explanation.**  
• Review & next step:  
We will review your submission and, based on the quality of the solution, decide whether to  
proceed with a follow-up interview session.  
• Format:  
You may choose the format (presentation deck, Miro board, document, or prototype). Please  
structure it so a senior audience can easily follow your reasoning independently.  
• Assumptions:  
You may make assumptions about the company, product, data, or partners as needed. **Please**  
**call these out explicitly and connect them to your conclusions. All assumptions should be marked.**
