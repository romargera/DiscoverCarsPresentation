Rental Contract Additional Terms and Conditions
ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The Contract will govern your rental of the Vehicle from us for the Rental Period. The “Contract” is made up of these Additional Terms and Conditions and the Rental Agreement Summary that we provide to you in connection with your rental (the “Summary”), as well as the description of potential fees and charges you may be required to pay (the “Fee Schedule”) https://www.enterprise.com/fees, the Privacy Policy https://privacy.ehi.com/en-us/home.html, and the Vehicle Condition and Equipment Report that we provide you in connection with your rental (“VCER”), all of which are incorporated by reference into these Additional Terms and Conditions as if fully set forth in this document. The Summary will control if there are discrepancies between it and these Additional Terms and Conditions. You and us are the only parties to the Contract, regardless of whether a third party may have been involved in arranging, negotiating, or paying for the rental. 1. Definitions: For purposes of the Contract, the following terms are specifically defined:

a. “Additional Authorized Driver(s)” means any individuals besides you who we permit to operate the Vehicle, including (i) the Authorized Drivers, (ii) Additional Authorized Drivers identified on the Summary or otherwise agreed to by us in writing; and (iii) if your Vehicle is rented under the Enterprise Truck Rental brand, your employer and any fellow employee(s) so long as they are properly licensed, 21 years of age or older, and are using the Vehicle for business purposes pursuant to a separate written agreement with us or our affiliates. All Additional Authorized Drivers must meet the minimum age requirements and hold a valid driver’s license to operate the Vehicle.

b. “Authorized Drivers” means your spouse or domestic partner, as long as they have your permission, meet the minimum rental age, and hold a valid driver’s license.

c. “Dollars” or “$” means (i) US Dollars, if your Rental Location is in the United States, or (ii) Canadian Dollars, if your Rental Location is in Canada.

d. “Optional Accessories” means the accessories listed on the Summary or that you otherwise accepted, which may include, child seats, non-pre-installed global positioning systems and similar products and services, ski racks, toll transponders, pads, straps, hand trucks, and other similar equipment.

e. “Owner,” “us”, or “we” means the Owner identified on the Summary.

f. “Rental Location” means the rental location identified on the Summary.

g. “Rental Period” means the period between the time you take possession of the Vehicle and the time we check in the Vehicle after you return it or it is otherwise recovered. However, in no event shall the Rental Period extend beyond [28] days. If a rental is ongoing for [28] days, you acknowledge that keeping the Vehicle beyond the end of the [28th] day is your consent to a new Rental Period subject to the terms and conditions in the original Contract and that may be assigned a new rental agreement number.

h. “Renter,” “you,” or “your” means the Renter identified on the Summary.

i. “Return Location” means the return location identified on the Summary.

j. “Vehicle” means the vehicle identified on the Summary or any replacement vehicle(s), inclusive of the vehicle as equipped and furnished by the manufacturer and any equipment, part, or accessory added by Owner, including, as applicable, keys, key fobs, transponders, and electric vehicle charging cables.

2. What You Must Pay Us.

a. Summary Charges. You must pay us, our affiliates, or agents all amounts listed on the Summary. Unless expressly modified on the Summary, (1) all charges are for a minimum of 1 day, and (2) “day” means each consecutive 24-hour period beginning at the Rental Time on the Summary.

b. Additional Charges. In addition to the amounts listed on the Summary, you may also be required to pay us, our affiliates, or agents the amounts listed on the Fee Schedule https://www.enterprise.com/fees, if applicable and not prohibited by law. The Fee Schedule forms part of the Contract and is incorporated by reference into these Additional Terms and Conditions as if fully set forth in this document.

c. Toll and Related Fees. We may charge you (i) a Tollpass Service Charge of up to $7.00 per day that you drive the Vehicle on a Tollpass Service area covered toll road if a toll collection transponder is pre-installed in the Vehicle or tolls are video-monitored (not to exceed $35.00 per Rental Period) or a Tollpass Device rental fee of up to $7.00 per day of the Rental Period, regardless of whether you drive the Vehicle on a Tollpass Service area covered toll road, if a toll collection transponder is available and rented from the Rental Location (not to exceed $35.00 per Rental Period), plus (ii) the actual cost of each toll incurred during the Rental Period at the cash toll rate or the highest undiscounted toll rate. As the Tollpass Service is optional, to avoid toll charges and related fees, you may use toll-free roads, pay tolls with cash (where available), or use any of the other methods described on our website, or in our toll brochures. A current list of Tollpass Service area covered roads is available at www.tollpassgo.com or (877) 765-5201. If you use a toll road not covered by the Tollpass Service, you may be subject to other fines and penalties as described in Section 2.b above.

d. Your Acknowledgements. With respect to any and all amounts you owe us under the Contract, you specifically acknowledge, authorize, and agree as follows:

(1) WE OR OUR AFFILIATE MAY PROVIDE YOUR NAME, ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD AND/OR DEBIT CARD INFORMATION, AND ALL OTHER NECESSARY INFORMATION TO ANY THIRD PARTY TO ENABLE COLLECTION OF OR TRANSFER LIABILITY FOR SUCH AMOUNTS, AND WE MAY DO SO WITHOUT ADDITIONAL NOTICE TO YOU.

(2) IF YOU PRESENT A CREDIT CARD OR DEBIT CARD AS A MEANS OF PAYMENT, DEPOSIT OR SECURITY, WE, OUR AFFILIATE, OR A THIRD PARTY MAY SUBMIT ALL AMOUNTS OWED UNDER THE CONTRACT FOR PAYMENT ON SUCH CARD(S), INCLUDING IF ANY THIRD PARTY TO WHOM A BILLING WAS DIRECTED REFUSES TO MAKE PAYMENT. IF WE INITIATE ANY CHARGE THAT IS DISHONORED, WE MAY RE-INITIATE THE CHARGE WITHOUT YOUR FURTHER AUTHORIZATION.

(3) We will take the amount on the Summary as an authorization or sale. Those funds will not be available to you until after the Vehicle is returned. We may take one or more incremental authorizations and/or deposits during the Rental Period if you incur additional charges.

(4) All amounts are subject to our final audit. Final amounts charged to your card may exceed amounts shown on the Summary if you incur additional charges.

(5) If a third party, such as an insurance company, authorizes payment of any amount owed by you under the Contract, by entering into the Contract you assign to us your right to receive such payment. Only those amounts actually paid to us by a third party will reduce the amount you owe under the Contract. Third party payments may be applied to: (i) vehicle upgrades or optional products (beyond those provided by the third party) or (ii) rental days beyond those specified by the third party. You remain responsible for all charges not paid by third parties, such as charges for vehicle upgrades, optional products, extra rental days, distance (mile or kilometre), fuel, and all other charges.

e. Our Right to Set Off. We reserve the right to set off or deduct from any amounts we may owe you under the Contract and any amounts you owe us under the Contract. Once we have determined the full extent of the amounts you owe us, we will attempt to refund any excess amounts collected from you within 20 business days. For payments made by cash, check or money order, refunds will be by check.

3. Who Owns the Vehicle and the Vehicle’s Condition.

a. Who Owns the Vehicle. The Vehicle and any Optional Accessories are our or our affiliate’s property, whether by ownership, beneficial interest, or lease, and even if owned, registered or titled to a third party. You are not our agent and have no authority to bind us.

b. The Vehicle’s Condition.

(1) You agree that you received the Vehicle and any Optional Accessories in good physical and mechanical condition. YOU ARE TAKING POSSESSION OF THE VEHICLE AND ANY OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES “AS-IS” AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE HAD AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO INSPECT THE VEHICLE AND ANY OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES AND THEIR OPERATION. WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, BOTH EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE VECHILE AND ANY OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS UNDER APPLICABLE SALE OF GOODS LAWS. You shall not alter or tamper with the Vehicle or any Optional Accessories. If you or an AAD determines the Vehicle or any Optional Accessories is unsafe or if any Vehicle warning lights turn on, you or the AAD shall stop operating the Vehicle and any Optional Accessories and notify us immediately.

(2) If your Vehicle is rented under the Enterprise Truck Rental brand, the following also apply:

(i) When required by applicable law, you must perform a daily inspection of the Vehicle, including (but not limited to): (a) inspecting the Vehicle to identify any damage or potential safety concern; (b) inspecting headlights, running lights, brake lights, and turn signals, and ensuring proper operation; (c) checking and maintaining all fluid level, including the hub oil level, if applicable; (d) checking tires to ensure proper tread depth and tire wear; and (e) checking and maintaining tire pressure per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Tire failure due to incorrect pressure will be your responsibility. If the State, Province, or Territory in which you operate the Vehicle has issued a standardized inspection schedule or minimum inspection requirements, you must follow that. Any inspection checklist that we may provide you is for reference only, and you are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable inspection requirements, including any requirement to maintain or cause AAD(s) to maintain a record of your or their daily inspections.

(ii) You must make the Vehicle available for required inspection and/or maintenance. If we need access to the Vehicle immediately (for example, because of a manufacturer recall), you must make the Vehicle available immediately. If we do not need access immediately, we will give you no less than 3 business days’ prior notice. If you do not make the Vehicle available according to the previous sentences, you will be responsible for the costs of all such maintenance, as well as any related damage arising from your delay in making the Vehicle available. You agree to provide us with distance (mile or kilometre) updates on the Vehicle upon our request. If the Vehicle’s ABS light is illuminated, you must immediately check the hub oil, if applicable. To obtain an accurate reading of the hub oil level, the Vehicle must be on level ground with the wheels pointed straight. If, at any time, including during a daily inspection, you determine that the hub oil is below the minimum level as indicated on the hubcap window or there appears to be a leak, you may not drive the Vehicle and must have it towed to a repair shop designated by us.

(iii) If you receive a VCER at the time of your rental, it will form part of the Contract and is incorporated by reference into these Additional Terms and Conditions as if fully set forth in this document. These Additional Terms and Conditions will control if there are discrepancies between it and the VCER.

4. What You May and May Not do With the Vehicle.

a. What You May do With the Vehicle. You may use the Vehicle during the Rental Period in accordance with the terms of this Contract and all applicable laws. You must return the Vehicle and any Optional Accessories to us on the return date or on our demand at the Return Location and in the same condition as received (ordinary wear and tear excepted). You may not mark the outside of the Vehicle unless directed by us or as otherwise required by applicable law. All such markings must be removed prior to returning the Vehicle, but you must not remove or alter our name or trademarks appearing on the outside of the Vehicle without our permission.

b. What You May Not do With the Vehicle. You may not do any of the following with, to, or in connection with the Vehicle, and you further acknowledge that doing so may void PEC, EP, SLP, and PAI to the extent permitted by applicable law:

(1) Use the Vehicle for any illegal purpose or in any illegal, fraudulent, or reckless manner, such as (i) in a race or speed contest, (ii) to tow or push anything without our prior written permission, (iii) to store or transport explosives, chemicals, corrosives, or any other hazardous materials or pollutants, (iv) by any person impaired by or under the influence of narcotics, alcohol, intoxicants, or drugs, used with or without a prescription, (v) to carry passengers in excess of the number of seat belts or outside the passenger compartment, (vi) in areas of civil unrest, including labor strike areas, (vii) without sufficient levels and types of fuel, coolants, lubricants, and other fluids, or (viii) except in an emergency, on anything other than a paved public highway or suitable graded private or public road or driveway or over bridges posted for a maximum of 3 tons (2,721.55 kilograms) or less;

(2) Allow any of the following to operate the Vehicle: (i) any person other than you or AAD(s) without our prior written consent, (ii) anyone who has given a fictitious name, false address, false or invalid driver’s license, or who has misrepresented or withheld material facts from us in connection with the rental, (iii) anyone whose driver’s license becomes invalid during the Rental Period, or (v) anyone who has obtained the keys without our permission;

(3) Transport persons for hire, as a school bus, or for driver training or testing;

(4) Transport goods or products for hire as a common carrier, a contract carrier or private carrier of property UNLESS (i) you obtain bodily injury and property damage liability insurance required of a motor carrier by all applicable authorities where the Vehicle is rented and operated, if different, (ii) upon our request, you provide satisfactory evidence of such insurance with us as an additional named insured and loss payee on the policy, and (iii) you and AAD(s) hold a valid class license for that purpose that complies with all applicable laws;

(5) Modify the Vehicle or any Optional Accessories, including by removing any seats from the Vehicle;

(6) Operate the Vehicle in a manner that violates the manufacturer’s specifications and guidelines, including by loading it in excess of its Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (“GVWR”) as indicated on the driver side door jam or with an improperly or unevenly divided load;

(7) Transfer or assign the Contract or sublease Vehicle, and any attempt to do so will be null and void;

(8) Test the Vehicle’s technological components or capabilities; or

(9) Take the Vehicle into Mexico without prior written consent. Even if we do consent (i) you must maintain or purchase insurance that applies in Mexico as we specify or approve prior to taking the Vehicle to Mexico, and (ii) DW, PEC, and SLP (as defined in Section 5 below) do not apply to accidents or events that occur in Mexico.

(10) If your Vehicle is rented under the Enterprise Truck Rental brand, the following also apply: (i) use the Vehicle other than in the ordinary course of your business, or (ii) use the Vehicle unless you are properly licensed and authorized by all applicable authorities (including but not limited to required licenses for interstate commerce and/or transporting property for hire).

c. If you use the Vehicle in a prohibited manner or violate any other provision of the Contract, we may immediately terminate your right to use the Vehicle without any further notice to you or AAD(s). In that case, we would have the right to seize the Vehicle without legal process or notice to you or AAD(s). We would also retain all of our other rights or remedies provided by law. By entering into the Contract, you and AAD(s) waive all claims for damages connected with our seizure, including loss or damage to contents or cargo, and shall pay all expenses we incur in returning the Vehicle to the Return Location.

d. If you or AAD(s) continue to operate the Vehicle after we have terminated your right to do so, we may notify police the Vehicle has been stolen. By entering into the Contract, you and AAD(s) agree to release and discharge us from and indemnify, defend and hold us harmless against any liability arising from such notice. You also remain responsible for all charges, costs, taxes, fees, and obligations as set forth in Section 2.

5. What Happens if the Vehicle is Damaged or Causes Damage.

a. Your Obligation to Report Accidents / Damage and Cooperate. You must report accidents, damage, loss or theft of the Vehicle to us immediately (and in no event later than the next business day following the accident and/or damage). You and AAD(s) must immediately deliver to the Rental Location every process, pleading or paper relating to any claims, suits, or proceedings arising from such accident, damage, loss, or theft. In the event of a claim, suit, or legal proceeding, you, AAD(s) and all other parties seeking benefits pursuant to the Contract shall cooperate fully with us and our representatives. You shall be responsible for assisting us in obtaining any necessary cooperation from an AAD. Cooperation may include (i) participating in examinations under oath, (ii) furnishing a signed statement of testimony, (iii) providing written or oral statements under oath, and (iv) any other matters we deem related to the adjustment of the claim, suit or proceeding. The Vehicle may be equipped with an Event Data Recorder (EDR), infotainment system and/or similar technology for the purpose of recording data about the operation and use of the Vehicle. To the extent permitted by law, you consent to us, our affiliate, or our representatives retrieving and using such data from the EDR or other technology, including during the adjustment of any claim, suit, or legal proceeding.

b. Your Responsibility to US. Except as restricted, modified or limited by applicable law, you accept responsibility for damage to, loss, modification or theft of, the Vehicle and Optional Accessories occurring during the Rental Period, regardless of whether you or another person were at fault or negligent, or if there was an act of God (i.e., an event out of anyone’s reasonable control). If you return the Vehicle outside of the Return Location’s business hours or to a location other than the Return Location, you acknowledge that this includes any damage to, loss, modification or theft that may occur before we check in the Vehicle. You must pay us the following amounts:

(i) With respect to the Vehicle:

(a) If we determine the Vehicle may be repaired (which repair you may not have done without our permission):

(1) the amount necessary to repair the Vehicle; plus

(2) a sum for loss of use (regardless of fleet utilization) equal to the total labor hours from the repair estimate divided by a number no less than 3 multiplied by the daily rate on the Summary; plus

(3) an administrative fee of up to $150; plus

(4) if the damage to the Vehicle is $500 or more, a sum for diminishment of value equal to 10% of the repair estimate.

(b) If the Vehicle is not returned, stolen, and not recovered, or if we determine the Vehicle is salvage:

(1) the fair market value of the Vehicle (which shall be equal to its retail value immediately before the loss) minus any sale proceeds, plus

(2) a sum for loss of use (regardless of fleet utilization) equal to 15 days multiplied by the daily rate on the Summary.

(ii) With respect to the Optional Accessories:

(a) If we determine the Optional Accessories may be repaired (which repair you may not have done without our permission), the amount necessary to repair them.

(b) If the Optional Accessories are not returned or if we determine they cannot be repaired, their replacement cost (for Rental Locations in the United States) or fair market value (for Rental Locations in Canada).

(iii) In addition to the amounts owed under (i) and (ii), if applicable, you must also pay or reimburse us for:

(a) All towing, storage or impound fees, and other costs we incur to recover the Vehicle and to establish damages, and

(b) Any taxes, fees and other mandatory charges imposed by governmental and/or airport authorities.

c. Your Responsibility to Third Parties. We or our affiliate comply with applicable motor vehicle financial responsibility laws as an insured, self-insurer, bondholder, or cash depositor. Except as required by applicable law, neither we nor our affiliate extend any of our motor vehicle financial responsibility or provide insurance coverage to you, AAD(s), passengers or third parties through the Contract. If liability insurance or self-insurance is available on any basis to you, AAD(s) or any other driver and such insurance or self-insurance satisfies the applicable motor vehicle financial responsibility law, then we or our affiliate extend none of our motor vehicle financial responsibility. In the event of an accident or occurrence that may cause legal liability to be imposed on us, our affiliate, you, and driver, and to the extent permitted under applicable law, motor vehicle liability insurance available to you is primary coverage and must respond to the liability of us, our affiliate, you, and driver. If we or our affiliate are required by applicable law to extend our insurance or motor vehicle financial responsibility and you and AAD(s) are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Contract, then our or our affiliate’s obligation is limited to the applicable minimum financial responsibility amounts. Any such extension of our or our affiliate’s motor vehicle financial responsibility shall not include a duty to defend you or any AAD unless required by law. Also, unless we or our affiliate are required by applicable law, our or our affiliate’s financial responsibility does not provide coverage for, nor extend to any of the following: (1) any claim made by a passenger in the Vehicle; (2) liability imposed or assumed by anyone under any worker’s compensation act, plan or contract; (3) punitive or exemplary damages (which include damages imposed to punish a wrongdoer or deter others from similar conduct) or costs, interest, or damages attributable to them; (4) fines; (5) penalties; (6) treble damages; or (7) multiplied or multiple damages imposed on any permissive operator. The punitive damage exclusion shall further apply to any claim for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverages. If you misrepresent information, provide us or our representatives with false or misleading information, or refuse to cooperate with us or our representatives during any claim, suit or proceeding, such claim may be denied.

d. Your Obligation to Indemnify Us. You must indemnify and hold us and our affiliate(s) harmless form all losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, claims, demands, costs, attorney fees, judgements, settlements, and other fees, costs and expenses that we or our affiliate(s) incur (including those we incur in relation to third parties) that arise in any manner from this rental transaction, any towing, or from anyone’s use of the Vehicle or Optional Accessories. You may present a claim to your insurance carrier for such losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, claims, demands, costs, attorney fees, judgements, settlements, and other fees, costs, and expenses; but, in any event, you will be ultimately responsible to us and our affiliate(s) for all such losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, claims, demands, costs, attorney fees, judgements, settlements, and other fees, costs, and expenses. Your obligation under this paragraph may be limited if you purchase optional DW, EP, and/or optional SLP to the extent they apply.

e. Optional Products that May Mitigate Your Responsibility or Enhance Your Rental.

(1) Optional Damage Waiver.

THE CONTRACT OR OTHER OF OUR MATERIALS MAY REFER TO DAMAGE WAIVER (DW), COLLISION DAMAGE WAIVER (CDW), OR LOSS DAMAGE WAIVER (LDW). THEY ALL REFER TO THE SAME PRODUCT AND WILL BE CALLED DAMAGE WAIVER OR DW IN THIS SUMMARY. DW IS NOT INSURANCE. THE PURCHASE OF DW IS OPTIONAL AND NOT REQUIRED IN ORDER TO RENT A VEHICLE.

You may purchase optional DW from us for an additional fee. If you purchase DW, we agree, subject to the actions that invalidate DW and the situations excluded from DW listed below, to contractually waive your damage responsibility for all or part of the cost of damage to, loss or theft of, the Vehicle and related costs, regardless of whether you were at fault or negligent. Our contractual waiver is limited to the amount initialed on the Summary, where applicable. If your Rental Location is in Canada, you may be able to purchase optional DW covering damage to the front windshield only. When deciding whether or not to purchase DW, you may wish to check with your insurance representative or credit card company to determine whether, in the event of damage to, or theft of, the Vehicle, you have coverage or protection for such damage or theft and the amount of your deductible or out-of-pocket risk.

The following shall invalidate DW and you will be responsible for damage to, loss or theft of the Vehicle:

a. if the Vehicle is damaged when used or driven:

(1) by any person other than you or AAD(s) without our prior written consent;

(3) by any person committing a felony, indictable offense, or otherwise engaged in a criminal act;

(4) in a race or speed contest;

(5) to tow or push anything without our prior written permission or in violation of the manufacturer’s specifications;

(6) outside the States, Provinces, or Territories authorized on the Summary, if applicable;

(7) under authority of any driver’s license that is suspended, revoked, invalid, or does not belong to the driver;

(8) to transport persons or property for hire;

(9) in a wanton or reckless manner of if Vehicle is deliberately damaged;

(10) except in an emergency, on anything other than a paved public highway or suitable graded private or public road or driveway, or over bridges posted for a maximum of 3 tons (2,721.55 kilograms) or less;

(11) to transport explosives, chemicals, corrosives, medical waste, or other hazardous materials or pollutants of any kind;

(12) in areas of civil unrest, including labor strike areas;

(13) in violation of applicable hours of service regulations;

(14) with the Vehicle loaded in excess of its GVWR;

(15) after the illumination of Vehicle warning lights and the damage is a result of the continued operation;

b. if you misrepresent facts to us pertaining to the rental, use, or operation of the Vehicle whether before or after any loss or damage;

c. if the Vehicle’s interior components are stolen or damaged when the Vehicle is unlocked, or keys are not secured;

d. if you fail to report or refuse to provide us, police, or other authorities with a full report of any accident or vandalism involving the Vehicle or otherwise fail to cooperate with us, police, or other authorities in the investigation of any accident or vandalism; or

e. if the Vehicle is stolen and you fail to do any of the following:

(1) return the original ignition keys and our key tag identifying the Vehicle;

(2) file a police report within 24 hours after discovering the theft;

(3) cooperate fully with us, police and other authorities in all matters connected with the investigation of the theft; or

(4) ensure that the Vehicle’s ignition is turned off at the time the Vehicle is stolen.

This Dispute Resolution Provision is to be broadly interpreted and applies to all Claims based in contract, tort, statute, or any other legal theory, and all Claims that arose prior to, during, or after termination of the Rental Period. For the purposes of this Dispute Resolution Provision “you” also includes any Additional Authorized Driver under the Contract, and any of your agents, beneficiaries or assigns, or anyone acting on your or their behalf, and “we,” “us,” or “our” also includes any of our employees, agents, affiliates, parents, subsidiaries, beneficiaries, assigns, and vendors, including but not limited to our service providers and marketing partners.

However, you and we each agree that either you or we may bring an individual action in a small claims court with valid jurisdiction, provided that the action remains in that court (other than any appeal of the small claims court ruling), is made on behalf of or against you only and is not made part of a class action, private attorney general action or other representative or collective action. Where required by law, you and we each agree that you may bring an individual action in the applicable court of justice. You and we also agree that claims against or by a third-party insurance company ostensibly providing coverage to you or any AAD or the application of our financial responsibility relating to the use or operation of the Vehicle may be brought in a court with valid jurisdiction. (1) Procedure: You or we, as applicable, must send a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing (a) the nature and basis of the Claim; and (b) the relief sought to the other party, as applicable. If your Rental Location is in the United States, the Notice to us should be addressed to: CT Corporation, 208 S LaSalle, Suite 814, Chicago, IL 60604; if your Rental Location is in Canada, the Notice to us should be addressed to: Baker & McKenzie LLP, Brookfield Place, Suite 2100, 181 Bay Street (PO Box 874), Toronto (Ontario) Canada M5J 2T3 (in either case, “Notice Address”). If you and we do not resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you may choose to commence an arbitration by filing a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules if your Rental Location is in the United States, or with the international Centre for Dispute Resolution Canada (“ICDR Canada”) pursuant to its Canadian Arbitration Rules if your Rental Location is in Canada. Claims will be resolved pursuant to the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules or ICDR, Canada’s Canadian Arbitration Rules, as applicable, in effect at the time of the demand, as modified by the Contract. A single arbitrator will be selected according to AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or ICDR Canada’s Canadian Arbitration Rules, as applicable. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both you and us with due consideration of our ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If you and we are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or ICDR Canada, as applicable, or by the arbitrator. The AAA rules are available online at www.adr.org. The ICDR Canada Canadian Arbitration Rules are available at www.icdr.org/icdrcanada. Except as required by law, neither you or us nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any dispute or arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both you and us. (2) Arbitrator’s Authority: For arbitrations before AAA, the arbitrator is bound by the Contract, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. For arbitrations before ICDR Canada, the arbitrator is bound by the Contract, the applicable arbitration legislation, and ICDR Canada’s Canadian Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator has no authority to join or consolidate claims, or adjudicate joined and consolidated claims. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of the Contract, including whether it is void. You and we agree that the arbitrator’s decision and award will be final and binding and may be confirmed or challenged in any court with jurisdiction as permitted under the FAA or the applicable Canadian arbitration legislation. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court, but only in favor of an individual claimant, whether you or us. (3) Arbitration Costs: You will be responsible for your share of any arbitration fees (e.g., filing, administrative, etc.), but only up to the amount of filing fees you would incur if the claims were filed in court. We will be responsible for all additional arbitration fees. You are responsible for all other costs/fees that you incur in arbitration, e.g., fees for attorneys, expert witnesses, etc. You will not be required to reimburse us for any fees unless the arbitrator finds that the substance of your claim(s) or the relief sought is frivolous. If the arbitrator makes such a finding, AAA Rules or ICDR Canada Canadian Arbitration Rules, as applicable, will govern the payment of all fees, and we may seek reasonable attorney’s fees, We will pay all fees and costs we are required by law to pay. (4) Governing Law and Enforcement: IF YOUR RENTAL LOCATION IS IN THE UNITED STATES – Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11, this Dispute Resolution Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the FAA, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.
