Insurance and Other Coverages
CLOSE
If renting in California:

 

Hertz provides no liability protection under the terms of the Rental Agreement to the renter from claims of injury by others against you resulting from an accident. Your personal/business insurance may cover your liability. Exceptions: Hertz will provide primary liability protection up to the statutory minimum limits to international customers (driver's license indicates an address outside the USA) renting in California. Please also refer to Liability Insurance Supplement (LIS) below.

 

If renting in Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, South Carolina, Virginia, or West Virginia:

 

Upon signing the Rental Agreement, Hertz provides primary liability protection. However, such protection is generally no more than the minimum limits required by individual state law. See Financial Responsibility Limits by State.

 

If renting in any other state in the U.S.A.:

 

Hertz' liability protection is secondary to any other insurance coverage available to you. If you do not have liability insurance and/or the limits of liability of the insurance coverage available to you are not sufficient to cover claims by others against you, and Hertz, as the vehicle owner, provides liability protection due to an accident, you will indemnify Hertz for any and all payments made.

 

However, Hertz makes available additional liability protection, which is primary, if the optional Liability Insurance Supplement, LIS, is purchased.

 

Liability Insurance Supplement (LIS)

 

For rentals in the U.S., Liability Insurance Supplement (LIS) provides you with up to $300,000 of increased protection should bodily injury and property damage claims be made against you by people injured in an accident. LIS safeguards your insurance policy and/or your personal assets for the first $300,000 should such claims be made against you. LIS provides uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage up to $100,000 per occurrence for combined bodily injury and/or property damage claims. Uninsured/ underinsured protection is not available in California and does not cover losses caused by the negligence of the renter or any authorized operator. You and authorized drivers are covered while driving the rental car within the United States and Canada, but only if the car is rented in the U.S. Coverage does not apply in Mexico.  LIS limits may vary in certain states, and terms and conditions apply. 

 

There are some exclusions to this coverage, including without limitation which we feel you should know. Under LIS, in the event of an accident, you will not be protected for third party liability:

If LIS is not accepted at commencement of the rental or if you fail to pay the charges for LIS.
If you permit the use of the car by anyone other than you or an authorized operator, or if you or an authorized driver operated the rental car in violation of otherwise violate the Rental Agreement, including, but not limited to, operating the car while legally intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol, drugs or other absorbed elements, for any purpose that could properly be charged as a crime, to tow or push anything, in a speed or racing contest or demonstration, to carry persons or property for hire, or to carry hazardous materials.
If the car or LIS coverage was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.
LIS is third party liability coverage only, except as pertaining to Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage (if applicable).
Except where permitted required by law, LIS does not cover personal injury to you or any authorized operator of the rental car or to your or their family members who are related by blood, marriage or adoption and reside in your or their household.
 

Liability Insurance Supplement (LIS) covers third-party automobile liability claims for bodily injury and property damage for rentals in the U.S.

If purchased, LIS will provide coverage before your personal policy and covers your liability to third parties, resulting from an auto accident in the rented vehicle, for bodily injury and property damage (other than to the rental vehicle).

Maximum LIS protection up to $300,000 for each accident for bodily injury and property damage in excess of minimum underlying state statutory limits.

*LIS limits may vary in certain states, and terms and conditions apply. Ask your rental representative.  Pricing of LIS for a specific rental will be provided at time of reservation.

 

Loss Damage Waiver (LDW)

In most states, in the event of any other loss or damage to the car, regardless of fault, your financial responsibility extends to the full value of the car at the time of rental, less its salvage value, plus expenses for towing, storage impound fees, an administrative fee and a reasonable charge for loss of use. If your responsibility differs in the state in which you rent, it will be stated in Paragraph 4, of the Rental Agreement. In California, in the event of any loss or damage to the car regardless of fault, your financial responsibility will in no event exceed the fair market value, plus actual charges for towing, storage, impound fees, and an administrative fee. In California and Nevada, your responsibility for loss or damage to the car from vandalism unrelated to theft will not exceed $500.00 in California and $2,500.00 in Nevada and you are not responsible for theft, regardless of purchasing LDW, unless the theft results from your fault.. In Illinois, your responsibility for loss or damage for any cause other than theft is limited to $15,500.00. Loss or damage related to theft is limited to $2,000.00, unless the theft results from your fault.  In New York, your financial responsibility shall not exceed (i) the actual and reasonable costs that Hertz incurs to repair the car, including costs for towing, storage and impound fees or that Hertz would have incurred if the car was repaired or (ii) the fair market value of the car immediately before the damages occurred, as determined by the applicable market for the retail sale of the car less disposal proceeds. Your responsibility for theft of the car shall not exceed the reasonable costs incurred by Hertz for loss due to theft up to its fair market value, if it is established that you or any authorized operator failed to exercise reasonable care or aided or abetted in the theft. 

 

However Hertz offers Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) an optional service, which for an additional daily charge relieves you of all financial responsibility for the loss or damage to the rental car, whether or not you have insurance to cover such damage, provided the car is used in accordance with the terms of the Rental Agreement. 
Please note that for all rentals with pick-up in Scottsbluff, Kearney and Grand Island, LDW reduces your financial responsibility to $ 2,500.00.

The cost of LDW may vary depending on location or car type and is charged per each full or partial day of rental.
 

F.Y.I. – You are under no obligation to purchase LDW or any other optional service as a condition of rental. Your own personal insurance may provide protection for loss or damage to the rental vehicle depending on the state in which you live and the type of policy you have. Also, various credit card companies provide cardholders with some degree of damage protection providing you use their credit card for the rental and decline the optional LDW offered by Hertz at time of rental. The coverage and limits vary. Your policy or credit card coverage should be thoroughly checked for the specific terms and conditions associated with rental vehicles. Remember, most credit card insurance is supplemental, which means it will only reimburse you for loss or damages over and above what is covered by any other insurance you may have and will not cover you for any damage, regardless of cause, if you accept LDW.

 

Adding LDW after car is on rental:
You may not change the option once the rental has begun, without returning the car and starting a new rental agreement.  This will result in the contract being closed out and charges being assessed for the time the vehicle is kept at least 1-day minimum, and a new rental contract will begin.

 

Cancellation of LDW - New York rentals only:

On New York rentals only, LDW may be cancelled at no charge, within 24 hours of its purchase provided the renter (i) has rented the car for 2 or more days; (ii) appears in person at any Hertz rental location with the car, which shall be subject to inspection.

Personal Effects Coverage (PEC)


Personal Effects Coverage (PEC), offered in combination with PAI, is an option that insures against risk of loss or damage to help protect your certain personal belongings while renting from Hertz. By electing PEC you will be insured throughout the entire rental period. PEC is insurance protection and pays in addition to any other policy you may have (such as a Homeowner’s policy). However, your benefits provided by other coverage may be affected by the PEC benefit. PEC insurance coverage includes those personal effects owned by you and those members of your immediate family traveling with you during the rental period who are permanent residents of your household. PEC does not extend to non-family members traveling with you.
