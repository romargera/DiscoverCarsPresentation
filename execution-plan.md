### Intro (slides 1-2)
# Slide Content |

### WHAT (slides 3-5)
# Slide Content |
|---|---|---|
| 3 Customer Pain Points | Open with "Day in the Life" story — specific customer scenario (Maria in Malaga, pressured at desk). Then insight framework: problem → frequency → severity → our solution fit. Segmentation: first-time renters vs experienced. Data: quotes from Trustpilot/Google reviews, industry stats (Phocuswright/Statista), Reddit posts |

### WHY (slides 6-9)
# Slide Content |
|---|---|---|
| 6 Market Opportunity & Strategic Fit | TAM/SAM sizing with assumptions and ranges. Competitive landscape: specific gap analysis (RentalCover/Rentalcars/Booking — what they do, where they are weak). Sincera advantage — why in-house insurance company = unfair advantage: iteration speed without external underwriter, data loop (claims → product → pricing), margin control. Cannibalization analysis — are we taking revenue from suppliers at desk, how it affects marketplace dynamics. Reference to current DiscoverCars booking flow |
| 7 Customer Trust as Competitive Moat | Why trust = higher attach rate + lower churn. Transparency principles (plain language, no dark patterns, clear exclusions, instant claims). Differentiation via trust vs competitors |
| 8 Unit Economics & Viability | Unit economics model (CAC, claim ratio, margin). Sensitivity analysis (what if claim ratio increases). Profitability drivers. Connection to Sincera P&L |
